## Introduction
Geodesic transformation of images can be implementated with two approaches: fast marching and raster scan. Fast marching is based on the iterative propagation of a pixel front with velocity F [1]. Raster scan is based on kernel operations that are sequentially applied over the image in multiple passes [2][3]. In GeoS [4], the authors proposed to use a 3x3 kernel for forward and backward passes for efficient geodesic distance transform, which was used for image segmentation.

DeepIGeoS [5] proposed to combine geodesic distance transforms with convolutional neural networks for efficient interactive segmentation of 2D and 3D images.

This repository provides a cpp implementation of fast marching and raster scan for 2D/3D geodesic and Euclidean distance transforms and a mixture of them, and proivdes a python interface to use it.
